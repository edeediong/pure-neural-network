# pure-neural-network

This is a pythonic implementation of a neural network without any frameworks.

## Getting Started
The dataset used is a bike sharing dataset and the aim of this project is to train a neural network to detect patterns in the dataset. We want to predict how many bikes we will need in the future.


## Prerequisites
Intermediate understanding of Python. This includes:
- OOP in Python
